Anomalies are a very unique card type introduced in World's Collide. They have been teased as possible cards from future sets. How many of these will we actually see in the future? We have absolutely no idea, but with how cool most of these are, I certainly hope we get some. Brad if you're reading, keep these coming please! There are a ton of possibilities these anomalies tease, from new mechanics to brand new houses. I breakdown my favorite anomalies by hype Inducing factor below, plus I rank them based on my personal power level opinion.
